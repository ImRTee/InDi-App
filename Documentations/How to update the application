# How to update a deployed app
# All you need to update is the 'src' folder located at /var/www/html/interactive-diagram/src

# 1. Change the permission of all files in src to allow the apache user to read and execute the files
sudo chmod -R 755 src
# 2. Make images folder writable so that the application can upload the image to there
sudo chmod a+w /var/www/html/interactive-diagram/src/static/images
# 3. Update the upload_folder path in app.py with the correct path
sudo vi /var/www/html/interactive-diagram/src/app.py
# Find the variable 'UPLOAD_FOLDER' and replace [project-name]  with the one you came up with

# 4. Update the database path in database.py to let the application know where to write the data to
sudo vi /var/www/html/interactive-diagram/src/common/database.py
# Find the variable 'mainDataBasePath' and replace [project-name]  with the one you came up with
